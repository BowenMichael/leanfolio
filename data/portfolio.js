      'Upgrade you car with new weapons and customizations by taking out various factions. When your ready take on THE WORM and bring peace back to the mojave.',

      '## Technical Details',
      '### Google Cloud',
      'At the beginning of the project we identified our ability to iterate as a key area of risk. ' +
      'To create a driving system that would be intuitive and function as players would expect we need to ' +
      'ensure we could test efficiently. We created the build server to drastically reduce the time and effort in creating a build.' +
      'This not only saved time when putting builds together but it saved time when testing because the builds were easily ' +
      'accessible. Every week we knew the state of the build which built confidence in how people interacted with the build.',
      '#### Overview',
      'The build server has 5 core elements that allow for this pipeline.',
      '\n- The repo(we used git)' +

      'The build also gets cached onto the build server instance so a large repo size is not a problem.',
      '#### Jenkins Server',
      'The Jenkins server exists as the brains of this operation. It manages all the commands, artifacts and manages the ' +
      'build instances. This supports user authentication so you can give your team access to this to avoid any build ' +
      'bottlenecks. anyone with access to the jenkins server can generate a build at any time',

      '#### Cloud build agents',
      'The cloud build agents are machines with larger allocations of compute to support building the game. ' +
      'This is where your game will be build before the build is saved. These machines are custom images ' +
      'so they can support any necessary third party libraries required for compute.', 
      '#### Google Cloud Buckets',
      'The builds then get saved to google cloud buckets. This gives anyone with access ' +
      'to the link the ability to download the game. this will reduce time to retreating your game and testing it.', 
      '#### Finally Team integration',
      'This is all good but if it is not publicly available to your team it will only exist in the background. ' +
      'Notifying your team via discord or slack is important to automatically communicate the build status to your team',

        '### Conclusion',

    details: ['### Overview',
    'This project was completed over 15 weeks as apart of a class on game engine development during the Fall of 2022. Creating an SDL window, game objects, components, and basic player movement were core to the course design. JSON parsing and 3D rendering were optional components. As a part of the final project I teamed up with Steven Annunziato to help with Implementing a 3D renderer.',
    'We made the design decision to ensure our solution allowed for custom shaders on a per object basis. We settled on bgfx for its wide use in games including Minecraft. It also abstracted the backend service decreasing the time and boilerplate for setting up OpenGL. With solid documentation we dove head first implementing a MVP matrix for each game object that had a cube component renderer.',
    '## Technical Details',
    'Below is a blog post going into all the details about our rendering implementation.',
    '### Personal Contributions:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* Implemented emscripten and windows build systems using SDL and C++.\n' +
    '* Utilized JSON file format for reading game object and component data.\n' +
    '* Worked on integrating bgfx 3D rendering library into the engine and built out a cube renderer component\n',
    '### Overview\n' +
    'In a world of game engines and package managers, it is easy to become detached from the core processes that make up modern software. For game developers, this comes in the form of software like Unity, Unreal Engine, Gamemaker, and Godot. Especially in 3D software, the process of rendering is taken for granted. Even the idea of creating an application window can be a concept that is hard to grasp. This was true for me before starting to build this engine. I have been using PCs since Windows XP yet I had no intuition about how to create a window.',
      'The Turbo Hybrid Game engine was created to teach myself how to build an application from scratch.\n' +
      'The goals for this engine:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '* Build a game engine application from scratch\n' +
      '* Compile to multiple platforms\n' +
      '* Data loaded from JSON\n' +
      '* Render 3D graphics',
      '### 3D Graphics\n',
      'The main chunk of this project was the 3D Graphics rendering. The project was completed as a part of the Champlain College Game Programming curriculum. But when it came to how we implemented Serialization and what we did for our final project approaches differed. I worked with [StevenAnnunziato](https://github.com/StevenAnnunziato) to develop our 3D graphics solution. We decided to implement bgfx as an intermediate graphics library. This allowed us to focus on the concepts of 3D rendering rather than getting stuck on lower ideas. This also allowed me to focus on integrating it into the engine while Steve was able to integrate the shaders.\n' +
      '\n',
      '#### Creating a render function\n',
      (<img width={'100%'} src='/projects/turbo-hybrid/Cube-rendering.png'/>),
      'The first thing I want to look at is the render function. Inside my main loop, I am creating two matrices that I am going to pass into bgfx to define my 3D space. These matrices are the view matrix and projection matrix. The View matrix defines my camera while the projection matrix determines the type of camera. the two most common types are perspective and orthographic. Here I am using perspective. This means I am defining a perspective camera.',
      '#### [glm::Namespace](https://github.com/g-truc/glm)',
      'GLM is a math library that we needed to use on windows because the built-in math library inside of bx was not suitable for use on windows. GLM is an open source header-only math library. GLM is based on the OpenGL specification which makes it perfect for our use.',
      (<CopyBlock text={mainRenderFunction} language={"cpp"} wrapLines={true} theme={dracula}/> ),
      '### Rendering Cube render components',
      'The Turbo hybrid engine uses a component bases structure of arrays. This means that all the components are stored on the stack right next to each other. By looping through an array of CubeRenderer components I compute specific actions. Each CubeRenderer component references the same vertex and index buffers that define the cube. They also are using the same shader program.',

      (<img width={'100%'} src='/projects/turbo-hybrid/turbo-hybrid-alternating-rotate.gif'/>),
      'This is what renders each cube component separately. Adding things like mesh information and setting different shaders would just be a matter of changing out the buffers and the program. Adding additional components for things like collision would be the first step to making a more versatile game engine.\n' +
      '\n',
      '### Conclusion\n',
      'I learned a lot from developing this engine. It was really satisfying to see all the steps of the process from window creation to rendering full 3D images. Bgfx was a great option for developing my own 3D components while maintaining control of the graphics pipeline while interfacing with your graphics backend of choice. It also supports various backends and platforms which makes it a great option for games. This project is only scratching the surface but I am really glad to of had the experience.',

    '* Contain some element of AI\n' +
    '* Contain some elements of customization to alter the experience for each player.\n',
    '### Review\n',
    'This project contained a lot of scope for a 10-week prototype. The networking, animations and general game feel were all areas that could have taken 10 weeks on there own. In this article I go into the struggles of learning networking while under specific time constraints, trying to work the student experience into an existing game idea, and reflecting on the competition. Working on a project like this without knowing networking presented some architectural pitfalls that were made obvious when data had to be sent over a network. Simple attacks and moving things across an inventory needed to be clear and serializable to communicate and display world events across a network.'*/],
