    'In a world of game engines and package managers, it is easy to become detached from the core processes that make up modern software. For game developers, this comes in the form of software like Unity, Unreal Engine, Gamemaker, and Godot. Especially in 3D software, the process of rendering is taken for granted. Even the idea of creating an application window can be a concept that is hard to grasp. This was true for me before starting to build this engine. I have been using PCs since Windows XP yet I had no intuition about how to create a window.',

      'The main chunk of this project was the 3D Graphics rendering. The project was completed as a part of the Champlain College Game Programming curriculum. But when it came to how we implemented Serialization and what we did for our final project approaches differed. I worked with [StevenAnnunziato](https://github.com/StevenAnnunziato) to develop our 3D graphics solution. We decided to implement bgfx as an intermediate graphics library. This allowed us to focus on the concepts of 3D rendering rather than getting stuck on lower ideas. This also allowed me to focus on integrating it into the engine while Steve was able to integrate the shaders.\n' +

      'The first thing I want to look at is the render function. Inside my main loop, I am creating two matrices that I am going to pass into bgfx to define my 3D space. These matrices are the view matrix and projection matrix. The View matrix defines my camera while the projection matrix determines the type of camera. the two most common types are perspective and orthographic. Here I am using perspective. This means I am defining a perspective camera.',
      '#### [glm::Namespace](https://github.com/g-truc/glm)',
      'GLM is a math library that we needed to use on windows because the built-in math library inside of bx was not suitable for use on windows. GLM is an open source header-only math library. GLM is based on the OpenGL specification which makes it perfect for our use.',

      '### Rendering Cube render components',
      'The Turbo hybrid engine uses a component bases structure of arrays. This means that all the components are stored on the stack right next to each other. By looping through an array of CubeRenderer components I compute specific actions. Each CubeRenderer component references the same vertex and index buffers that define the cube. They also are using the same shader program.',

Adding additional components for things like collision would be the first step to making a more versatile game engine.\n' +

      '### Conclusion\n',
      'I learned a lot from developing this engine. It was really satifying to see all the steps of the process from window creation to rendering full 3D images. Bgfx was a great option for developing my own 3D components while maintining control of the graphics pipline while interfacing with your graphics backend of choice. It also supports various backends and platforms which makes it a great option for games. This project is only scratching the surface but I am really glad to of had the experience.',

    'This project contained a lot of scope for a 10-week prototype. The networking, animations and general game feel were all areas that could have taken 10 weeks on there own. In this article I go into the struggles of learning networking while under specific time constraints, trying to work the student experience into an existing game idea, and reflecting on the competition. Working on a project like this without knowing networking presented some architectural pitfalls that were made obvious when data had to be sent over a network. Simple attacks and moving things across an inventory needed to be clear and serializable to communicate and display world events across a network.'*/],
