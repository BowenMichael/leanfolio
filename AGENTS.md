# Autonomous Agent Guidelines & Budget Guardrails

This project follows the **Antigravity Autonomous Agent Protocol & Issue-Driven Development Lifecycle**. All AI agents operating in, or contributing to, `leanfolio` MUST strictly adhere to the following rules:

---

## 1. Mandatory Worktree Development & Task Lifecycle (CRITICAL)

### A. Git Worktree Isolation (Strictly Enforced)
To prevent interference with the developer's active editor, other agent sessions, or local uncommitted changes:
1. **Zero Direct Edits in Main Checkout**: All feature development, refactoring, and bug fixes MUST occur in an isolated Git worktree under `.worktrees/<branch-name>` (e.g. `.worktrees/feat-<feature-name>` or `.worktrees/issue-<number>`).
2. **Worktree Creation**:
   ```bash
   git worktree add -B "feat/issue-<number>-<short-description>" ".worktrees/issue-<number>" origin/main
   ```
3. **Execution**:
   - All file edits, Next.js builds, lints, and commits must be scoped exclusively to the worktree directory.
4. **Completion & Cleanup**:
   - Push the branch from the worktree:
     ```bash
     git push origin feat/issue-<number>-<short-description>
     ```
   - Open a Pull Request linking to the issue with visual proof, test logs, and acceptance criteria verification.
   - Clean up the worktree once the branch is merged/archived:
     ```bash
     git worktree remove .worktrees/issue-<number>
     ```

### B. Issue Takeover Notification
When picking up an issue from GitHub:
1. **Selection**: Look for issues with Project Board Status **`📋 Ready for Agent`** or label `ready` / `agent:ready`.
2. **Immediate Project Board Update**:
   - Move the card on the GitHub Project Board directly to **`⚡ In Progress`**.
   - **CRITICAL**: Do NOT add, remove, or modify GitHub issue labels/tags. Status transitions are managed purely via Project Board columns.
3. **Mandatory Issue Takeover Comment**:
   The agent **MUST immediately comment** on the GitHub issue to notify the team that development has commenced:
   ```markdown
   🤖 **Agent Takeover: Development Started**

   - **Worktree**: `.worktrees/issue-<number>`
   - **Branch**: `feat/issue-<number>-<short-description>`
   - **Planned Approach**:
     1. [Step 1: Implementation blueprint & file inspection]
     2. [Step 2: Core changes, responsive verification, and validation]
     3. [Step 3: Verification, demo recording, and PR creation]
   - **Budget Guardrail**: Max 15 tool execution turns before pause & review.

   ```

### C. Issue & Project Board Synchronization (Anti-Duplication Protocol)
To ensure multiple agents or team members never duplicate work:
1. **Check Claim Status First**:
   - Before taking any action on an issue, verify it is strictly in `📋 Ready for Agent` state and has no active worktree in `.worktrees/`.
   - If an issue is already in `⚡ In Progress`, `🔍 In Review`, or has an active worktree, **DO NOT TOUCH IT**.
2. **Post Deliverables Directly to the GitHub Issue**:
   - **Never keep answers only in local IDE chat.**
   - All architecture specifications, deployment guides, research findings, and task completions must be posted as formal comments on the GitHub issue.
3. **Mark Acceptance Criteria Checkboxes**:
   - When criteria are satisfied, update the GitHub issue body via API to check off the boxes (`- [x]`).
4. **Move to Review**:
   - Once all criteria are met, move the card on the Project Board to **`🔍 In Review`**.

## 2. 🛑 Token & Complexity Budget Guardrail (Mandatory Pause)

To ensure tasks remain cost-effective and prevent run-away context/token consumption, the agent must enforce the following guardrail:

### Thresholds & Automated Circuit Breakers
- **Turn Limit (Enforced)**: If a single task reaches **15 tool execution turns** without completing the implementation, the runner halts execution automatically.
- **Duplicate Tool Call Circuit Breaker**: If the agent executes the exact same tool with identical arguments **3 consecutive times**, the runner terminates the process immediately to prevent infinite token spend.
- **Excessive File Reading Circuit Breaker**: If the agent performs **8 consecutive file view operations** without making any code edits or running tests, the runner pauses execution.
- **Token Budget**: If the session approaches the session token budget limit (default: 150,000 tokens).

### ⚡ Mandatory Tool Efficiency Directives (Anti-Loop Protocol)
To ensure context windows remain clean and prevent repetitive re-reading:
1. **Search Before Viewing**: Always use `grep_search` to pinpoint the exact function, component, or style location before calling `view_file`.
2. **Mandatory Line Range Slicing**: When calling `view_file`, ALWAYS specify `StartLine` and `EndLine` (maximum 100 lines per call). Never view entire files over 200 lines at once.
3. **Zero Redundant Re-Reading**: Never call `view_file` on the same file or lines you have already inspected within the active turn. Trust your context window.
4. **Action-Oriented Exploration**: Limit exploration to 3–4 targeted searches/reads before writing code or running tests.

### Mandatory Pause Protocol
When a threshold or circuit breaker is reached, execution is halted automatically:

1. **Post Insights Breakdown** (both as an Issue comment and in the dashboard stream):
   ```markdown
   ⚠️ **Task Paused: Token / Complexity Budget Threshold Reached**
   
   ### 📊 Task Insights
   - **Progress Completed**: [Summary of files edited and components built]
   - **Remaining Work**: [Exact items needed to reach acceptance criteria]
   - **Cost / Complexity Driver**: [Explain why token consumption or turn count is high]
   - **Proposed Next Action**: [Option A: Approve 15 more turns to finish; Option B: Narrow scope; Option C: Human intervention]

   ```
2. **Await User Approval**:
   - The agent MUST NOT take further code modification actions until the user explicitly responds with approval to proceed via the Agent Manager UI or GitHub comment.

---

## 3. Command Log Suppression (User Global Rule)
- **Suppress Verbose Output**: Never run build, test, typecheck, or lint commands directly in the shell without redirection if they produce verbose output. Instead, redirect their output to a temporary log file:
  ```powershell
  npm run lint > lint_run.log 2>&1
  npm run build > build_run.log 2>&1
  ```
- **Inspect on Failure Only**:
  - If the command succeeds (exit code `0`), do not output or read the log file.
  - If the command fails (exit code non-zero), view *only* the last 20 to 50 lines of the log file to diagnose the error:
    ```powershell
    Get-Content -Tail 40 lint_run.log
    ```
- **Clean Up**: Delete temporary log files immediately once the check is complete:
  ```powershell
  Remove-Item lint_run.log, build_run.log -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
  ```

---

## 4. Chat Lifecycle & Re-Queued Task Ingestion
- **Chat Stays Open Until 'Done'**: Agent sessions and chats must remain open and interactive in `IN_REVIEW` for continuous user feedback, questions, and testing until the card is explicitly moved to `✅ Done` on the Project Board.
- **Re-Queued Task Ingestion**: When an issue is moved back into `📋 Ready for Agent`, the system automatically inspects the issue for new user comments or requirement edits and feeds them into the existing agent session as continuation context in its active worktree.

---

## 5. 🧱 Modular Architecture & Strict Anti-Monolith Directives (Mandatory)

To prevent LLM context saturation, token bloat, and self-attention repetition loops:

1. **Zero New Monolithic Files**:
   - Never create single files exceeding **250 lines of code**.
   - Always decompose features across dedicated, modular files adhering to the Single-Responsibility Principle:
     - `components/` for individual UI elements (decompose complex sections into modular subcomponents).
     - `styles/` or theme modules for styling tokens.
     - `utils/` or `data/` for portfolio content and helper utilities.
2. **Decompose When Modifying Existing Monoliths**:
   - If an existing file exceeds **300 lines**, DO NOT append large new blocks of code directly into it.
   - Extract new helper functions, sub-components, or utility classes into separate modular files, importing them into the larger file.
3. **No Monolithic File Inspection**:
   - Never dump entire monolithic files into context via un-sliced `view_file`.
   - Always use `grep_search` to pinpoint target symbols, and read with sliced ranges (`StartLine`/`EndLine`, max 100 lines).
4. **Architectural Planning Stage Requirement**:
   - In Stage 2 (Architecture Planning), the planner model MUST design a modular file structure with explicit file paths rather than planning additions into a single monolithic file.

## 6. 📝 Mandatory CHANGELOG.md Maintenance

To maintain clear auditability, release tracking, and project evolution across autonomous agent runs:

1. **Mandatory CHANGELOG Update**:
   - Every issue or task implemented by an agent **MUST update `CHANGELOG.md`** in the repository root before submitting work for review (`🔍 In Review`) or opening a Pull Request.
   - If `CHANGELOG.md` does not exist in the repository root, the agent **MUST initialize it** following standard [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) guidelines.
2. **Standard Section & Categories**:
   - Always append changes under an `## [Unreleased]` section at the top of the file (or under the active version release section).
   - Categorize all bullet points using standard subheadings:
     - `### Added` for new features or user-facing capabilities.
     - `### Changed` for changes in existing functionality or workflows.
     - `### Deprecated` for soon-to-be removed features.
     - `### Removed` for now-removed features.
     - `### Fixed` for any bug fixes.
     - `### Security` for security fixes or vulnerability mitigations.
     - `### Performance` for performance optimizations.
3. **Entry Format Requirements**:
   - Each entry must be concise and descriptive: explain *what* changed and *why*.
   - Reference the GitHub issue number (e.g., `(#<issue-number>)`) or Pull Request at the end of each bullet point.
4. **Verification & Checklist**:
   - In the PR description and final completion comment on GitHub, the agent must explicitly confirm that `CHANGELOG.md` has been updated with the change entries.
