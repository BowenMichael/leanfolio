* General web development and AI work
* User experiance or AI developer
* Focused on his work and commucating in a casual manner with others

# General Considerations
* this website is a great template for getting started but could do some things to really take it to the next level. allowing the use to edit the page in real time would help a lot. obviously this comes at the cost of some kind of database however maybe there is another way to have real time page editing. I really like the direction of the page and can see a lot of developers using a formatted site like this!
